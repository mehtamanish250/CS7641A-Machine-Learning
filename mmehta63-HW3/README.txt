- Extract the contents of zip file mmehta63-HW3.zip (hosted at : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMqxRkeBI1FUlIfvE_rQA_kACCxb-6uj/view?usp=sharing)
- Keeping the directory the same, the two Jupyter Notebook files are to be used for reproducing the results of the experiment.
- For the first 3 parts of the assignment, where new datasets - Handwritten Digits and Breast Cancer data are being used, run the first notebook "CS7641 HW3 Handwritten and BreastCancer Code.ipynb"
- For the parts 4 and 5 of the assignment where we have to use earlier dataset (Phishing data in this case), use notebook "CS7641 HW3 Phishing Code.ipynb"
- Make sure that the folder structure you get on extracting the contents of the zip file is intact and all at one place
- "results" folder contains the clustering centers for each of the scenarios
