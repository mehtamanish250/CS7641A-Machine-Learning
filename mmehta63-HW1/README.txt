The dataset and the code files are inside the zip file (mmehta63-HW1.zip). It contains the following files:

	- BankMarketingData.csv --> Banking data
	- PhishingWebsitesData.csv --> Phishing data
	- mmehta63-HW1.ipynb --> Notebook containing the relevant code that has the implementation of the 5 algorithms and you can run it cell by cell
	- mmehta63-HW1.py --> the same notebook exported as a Python file in case you want to run everything all together, and not cell by cell. 

Please take care that when the zip file is extracted, all its contents remain in the same place, since the .csv files are need to be read in the .py and .ipynb files and so should be in the same folder as them.

Prerequisites:
