1. Install jython.

3. Keep the file contents at the same place after extracting the zip file.
4. Navigate to folder "code"
5. Use jython to run easyGW and hardGW python files (for eg. if jython is installed in C:\jython2.7.0, then use the below commands. Otherwise repalce with your own path where jython is installed and use path to its bin folder and run this).
    command: 
    C:\jython2.7.0\bin\jython  easyGW.py 
    C:\jython2.7.0\bin\jython  hardGW.py 
6. Results from the run are stored in folders easyGW and hardGW
